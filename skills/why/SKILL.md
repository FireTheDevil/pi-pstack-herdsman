# Why

For Herdsman launch, discovered definitions, asynchronous results, external isolation, and tool prerequisites, read [Herdsman runtime](../poteto-mode/references/herdsman-runtime.md) when needed. Required capabilities must be available before launch.

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code.

Companion to the `how` skill. `how` answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

## Operating Posture

Operate as a **careful, cautious, and precise investigator**. Be honest about what you know vs what you're inferring. Read `references/epistemics.md` for the full confidence framework and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.

## Step 1. Understand the Target and the Question

Parse what the user is asking. The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually a design rationale, a tradeoff, a motivating edge case, an external constraint, dead code, or a broad history sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from conversation context (open files, recent edits, cursor location, what was just discussed). State your interpretation briefly so the user can redirect if you're off, then proceed.

## Step 2. Establish the Code Anchor

Before spawning investigators, anchor the investigation in concrete code. Gather available history in the lead session; the shipped `pstack-investigator` has no shell or `gh`. You need:

- The relevant file path(s) and line range(s)
- The key symbols (function names, class names, constants)
- An initial commit list where source-control history is accessible. The last few commits touching the target.
- PR numbers from merge commits (pattern `(#1234)` in the subject line), when available.

Build this inline.

```bash
# Blame target lines for last-touch commits
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>

# Full file history, with patches, through renames
git log --follow -p -- <file>

# Last N commits touching the file, PR numbers visible
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>

# Extract PR numbers from a commit message
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
```

If the lead has `gh` and authorization, pull PR bodies and discussion for substantive commits:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Capture this as seed context (file paths, symbols, commits, PR numbers, linked ticket IDs). Pass it to the investigators.

## Step 3. Spawn Parallel Investigators (default posture)

**Default to parallel investigation of reachable evidence.**

### Discovery

Before spawning investigators, list the available MCP tools in this Pi session. Use the available-tools map when present. Otherwise inspect the project and user Pi MCP configuration for enabled servers.

Map each available MCP to one evidence category:

1. Source control history
2. Issue / ticket tracker
3. Long-form documents
4. Real-time team chat
5. Infrastructure observability
6. Error / exception tracking
7. Product analytics warehouse

Source control may be available to the lead through git or `gh`, but neither tool is in the shipped investigator profile. Collect history in the lead and pass relevant snapshots as files; otherwise mark history blocked. For the other six, classify using the MCP name, server instructions, tool names, and resource descriptors. If an MCP could fit more than one category, choose the one matching its primary evidence. Record ambiguous cases in the coverage map.

Aim for a complete **coverage map**, not a minimal one. Document unavailable categories as gaps; a tool visible to the lead is not automatically available to a child.

Launch separate `agent_delegate` assignments only for categories whose evidence files or verified tools the selected definition can actually access. Collect every attributed completion before synthesis. Don't ask one agent to cover multiple MCPs.

Herdsman task assignment for each source:
- Herdsman definition: `pstack-investigator` for local source-control evidence; `pstack-researcher` for web or MCP evidence. Confirm target tool availability before launch.
- Use model/thinking from the effective discovered definition. Global definitions override project definitions; there are no per-request model fields.
- Required capabilities must exist in the effective definition. Shipped investigator/researcher/advisor tools are local read-only. For shell or live MCP access, obtain explicit authorization to customize a definition with verified installed tools/extensions first, or report that evidence source blocked. There is no run allowlist request field.

Nonblocking dispatch does not grant MCP tools. Verify target provider availability first. Investigators should not write repository files.

Each investigator gets:
1. The base prompt from `references/investigator-prompt.md`
2. The category playbook `references/sources/<source>.md` for the selected MCP, adapted from the examples in `references/source-playbook.md`
3. The cross-cutting `references/sources/incident-postmortem.md` **if the target code looks defensive** (null checks, retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers)
4. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
5. The user's original question

### Investigator roster. One per available evidence category

Spawn one investigator per category that has a matching MCP. Each owns exactly one tool or MCP.

Each entry names the category and the kind of "why" it uniquely surfaces. Use it to know what to expect back, how to name a gap when a category returns empty, and (only in the rare provably-irrelevant case) to justify a skip.

1. **Source control investigator**. Code comments and tests are readable locally; git history and PR discussion require lead-supplied snapshots or an explicitly customized definition with shell access. Spawn when this evidence is available. Best at surfacing *implementation-time rationale captured during review*.

2. **Issue / ticket tracker investigator** (e.g. Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut MCP). Best at surfacing *the product or business forcing function*. Strongest when the why is external to engineering.

3. **Long-form documents investigator** (e.g. Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Coda MCP). Best at surfacing *long-form design rationale*. Where the why is written out before it becomes code.

4. **Real-time team chat investigator** (e.g. Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost MCP). Best at surfacing *real-time deliberation that never reached a doc*. Especially important when the source control, ticket, and doc paper trail is thin.

5. **Infrastructure observability investigator** (e.g. Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk MCP). Infra/runtime view. Best at surfacing *infrastructure and runtime reality that motivated the code*. Strongest when the target reacts to an infra signal (timeouts, retries, rate limits, circuit breakers).

6. **Error / exception tracking investigator** (e.g. Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake MCP). Best at surfacing *the specific exceptions and error trajectories that motivated defensive or corrective code*. Strongest for catch blocks, null guards, type checks, retries, and other defenses.

7. **Product analytics warehouse investigator** (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt, Redshift MCP). Product/data view. Best at surfacing *product and data reality that shaped the code*. Strongest for flag-gated code, experiment-driven ships, data migrations, and "where did this number come from" questions.

### When to skip an investigator

Only skip with an **explicit, written justification** that goes in the final "Sources Consulted" section. Two valid reasons:

- **No accessible evidence or authorized tool is available for that category** in this environment. Flag this as a gap, not a choice. Example: "Real-time team chat skipped. No matching MCP or supplied snapshot was available, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not just "probably irrelevant." A high bar. Example: "Error / exception tracking skipped. Target is a build-time script with no runtime code path."

If your scope assessment suggests a single-commit trivial target where the PR description already contains the complete answer, you may answer inline after checking available categories and naming the gaps. Say so explicitly.

## Step 4. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer background child:

- Herdsman definition: `pstack-advisor`
- Use model/thinking from the effective discovered definition. Global definitions override project definitions; there are no per-request model fields.
- Required capabilities must exist in the effective definition. Shipped investigator/researcher/advisor tools are local read-only. For shell or live MCP access, obtain explicit authorization to customize a definition with verified installed tools/extensions first, or report that evidence source blocked. There is no run allowlist request field.

Configured MCP adapters and permissions must be available in the child. Evidence files do not add capabilities. Results arrive asynchronously; end the turn and yield when only dependencies remain.

The synthesizer gets:
1. Exact returned investigator result refs through files, including null results and categories skipped with justification
2. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
3. The user's original question
4. The epistemics framework from `references/epistemics.md`
5. The synthesizer prompt template from `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`

## Step 5. Present

Take the synthesizer's output and present it to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but **do not rewrite the confidence language**.

## Output Format

The output structure is the one in `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`: The Question, The Code in Question, What We Found, What We Can Reasonably Infer, Competing Hypotheses, What We Don't Know, Sources Consulted, Confidence Summary. Adapt as needed, but keep the confidence separation intact, and keep Sources Consulted as one line per investigator, including the ones that returned nothing or were skipped, with the reason.

After the Sources Consulted block, if the user's `why` question is a precursor to actually changing this code, convert the lineage findings into a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk constraint set suitable for planning the change.

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- **Recency bias**. Assuming the most recent commit is authoritative. The current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.

## Reference Files

- `references/epistemics.md`. Confidence tiers and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.
- `references/investigator-prompt.md`. Base prompt template for investigator subagents.
- `references/source-playbook.md`. Index pointing at the category playbooks below.
- `references/sources/*.md`. One self-contained example playbook per category, plus cross-cutting `incident-postmortem.md`. Give an investigator the single file that matches its category and adapt it to the available MCP.
- `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`. Prompt template for the synthesizer subagent, including the output format.
